**Python Support**

    For Linux, OS X, or *nix

1) build CyaSSL with fpic on Linux, not needed on OS X
    ./configure --disable-shared CFLAGS=-fpic
    make
    sudo make install

  NOTE: if you want to use pbkdf pkcs #12 algorithm you should build CyaSSL with --enable-pwdbased:
  ./configure --disable-shared --enable-pwdbased CFLAGS=-fpic


2) start the example echoserver from the examples/echoserver directory
    ./echoserver

3) run ./PtyonBuild.sh from this directory it will
    a) build the swig wrapper file
    b) compile the swig wrapper and cyassl wrapper files
    c) place them into a cyassl shared library for python
    d) run runme.py which will connect to the CyaSSL echo server, write a
       string, then read the result and output it


    Windows only

1) Make sure the install path to cyassl doesn't have any spaces anywhere in the
   directory path because swig doesn't like that
2) Have python for Windows installed, note install directory
3) Have swigwin installed, note install directory
4) Make sure swigwin install direcotry is added to PATH env. variable
5) Make sure env. variables PYTHON_INCLUDE and PYTHON_LIB are set correctly e.g.
    PYTHON_INCLUE="c:\Python26\include"
    PYTHON_LIB="c:\Python26\libs\python26.lib"
6) Build python_cyassl in Release mode only, Debug build fails to find a debug
    python library that isn't included by default
7) The outputs _cyassl.pyd and cyassl.py are the cyassl import library
8) Can now run python runme.py from the swig directory
